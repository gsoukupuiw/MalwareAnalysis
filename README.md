Analyzed file 6202024_Statement.HTML received via phishing email 6/20/2024. The file contained an obfuscated java script function. 
Decoding of the JavaScript function revealed a decoded URL of https://bc1q9w8rz76wl70pqdf67rl.com/lnk/web.js. 
The scripts function appeared to be to receive and execute a payload from the URL.
Beautiful soup was used to capture and save the payload safely without execution.
The payload appeared to be another highly obfuscated java script function.
An attempt to further decode the payload was unsuccessful, however heuristic analysis revealed that the code is likely a remote access trojan (RAT) know as HTML/ExpKit.Gen2, a derivative of the Brushaloader trojan with RAT (Remote Access Tool) capabilities.
